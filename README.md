# Lighting Models
An app for demonstrating local lighting models.
The app allows you to select a 3D model from a list to which the lighting model will be applied. The following lighting models are available:
1. Lambert
2. Toon shading
3. Oren-Nayar
    Includes a roughness parameter (ranging from 0 to 1). 
4. Phong
    Includes a specular coefficient as a parameter (must be 1 or greater).
5. Cook-Torrance
    Includes multiple customizable parameters, such as roughness (ranging from 0 to 1), refractive index (must be 1 or greater) and metallic property coefficient (ranging from 0 to 1).
6. Ashikhmin-Shirley
    Includes multiple customizable parameters, such as refractive index (must be 1 or greater), n_u and n_v coefficients that determine a shape of anisotropic specular reflection (must be 0 or greater).
